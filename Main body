# A program to remind the user to take a break from their computer every hour
# the reminding prompt is a music video from YouTube 
import webbrowser
import time 

# REPEAT every hour

total_breaks = 12
breaks_taken = 0
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6f80tQ3WRM"

print("This program started on " + time.ctime())
while (breaks_taken < total_breaks):
    time.sleep(3600)
    breaks_taken = breaks_taken + 1
    webbrowser.open(url)

# close the browser 

# automate the running of this program when the computer is turned on
# in a way that only needs the terminal and not WING or IDLE 
# soln: use Task Scheduler; python script is run when I log on 

# Note: initial project idea from Udacity Course "Programming Foundations with Python"
